# Key-Sounds
## A program to make you key presses sound like other keyboards
* Currently there is only NK cream sounds taken from [Glarses Soundtouch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_9vXJZVT54)
* I will most likely take sound test audio and fill in the sound's of different switches
* I will try to keep the entire project free for its lifespan (its open source anyways)
