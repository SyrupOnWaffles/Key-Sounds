# Key-Sounds
## A program to make you key presses sound like other keyboards
Currently there are two sound themes:

NK Creams: [Taken from Glarses' soundplant demonstration](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ND88io8f4qIt5Ku2TJ21_LQqB6ju8r2P)

and

Tecsee Carrots: [Taken from KeebsForAll's sound test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfXZva14Oc4)

I will add more switches in the future. Keep in mind however that taking sound test audio isnt perfect as sounds played on higher volumes sound quite terrible (Use the carrots as a test (ू˃̣̣̣̣̣̣︿˂̣̣̣̣̣̣ ू).
